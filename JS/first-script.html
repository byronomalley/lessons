<!-- JAVASCRIPT

STATEMENTS - specifying small computations
             numerous statements create behaviour of a page

VARIABLES AND VALUES
    var winners = 2
    var isEligible = false;   boolean values require no quotation marks

          - you can create variables and assign values to them later
          - no spaces allowed in variable names

EXPRESSIONS - evaluat values

var total = price - (price * (discount / 100));
            /           EXPRESSION           /

var scoops = 5        ------------------ set scoops to 5
while (scoops > 0) {   ----------------- evaluate the while statement to see if its true
  document.write("Another scoop!") ; --- the first string in the body "another scoop"
  scoops = scoops - 1;  -----------------
}

WHILE statement = a keyword, condition, a block of code to be executed if conditions
                    are met, and a loop is made to do it all again
     - Most often used when you dont know how many times you need to loop

FOR  - same as WHILE but more convenient
- variable declaration and initalisation in the first part of the statement
- packages variable initialisation, a conditional test and variable increments in one statement
- most often used when you know how many times you need to loop


IF and ELSE - allow us to make decisions in code

PROMPT - browsers provide a built in prompt function to get input from a user
- causes a dialogue box to open with a string of text, like ALERT,
-  but it also provides a place for the user to give a response
- this response in the form of a string, is then returned as a result of calling a function
- no response = "null" = no value

BLOCK OF CODE - set of statements, or one statemet within curly braces

BOOLEAN OPERATORS - used in a boolean expression resulting in a true or false value
- two kinds - COMPARISON  LOGICAL

  ARIHMETIC OPERATORS
   +-*/

   = - assigns value to a variable

  COMPARISON OPERATORS - compare two values

   = - assignement operator assigning values to variables

   < - less than

   > - more than

   == - used to see if one value is equal to another, takes types into account == converts the type of one
- COMPARING A NUMBER TO A STRING
- the string is always converted to a number
- not all strings can be converted to numbers = NaN = not equal to anything = false
-"ninety nine" cannot be converted to a number
- "true" cannot be converted to a number
- COMPARING A BOOLEAN TO ANY OTHER TYPE
- sometimes requires more than one type conversion
- true converts to one, false converts to 0
- comparing strings to booleans, both types are converted to numbers
- COMPARING NULL TO UNDEFINED
- both these values are represent "no value", none for the variable, non for the object = always equal
- COMPARING STRINGS TO STRINGS
- alphabet comes into play = "bannana" is less than "mango" is less than "melon
- Unicode - standard for representing characters digitally"


   === - strict equality, exactly equal to - identity operator
- values are only equal if the have the same type and the same value

   <= - less than or equal to

   >= - more than or equal to

   != - not equal to
   !==
   !===

  LOGICAL OPERATORS - combine two boolean expressions to create one boolean result - true or false
   || - OR operator, combines test together in IF and results true if either expression is true
   && - AND operator, results true if both expressions are true
   ! - NOT operator, acts on one boolean expresson instead of two, results in true if expression is false

   COMBINING OPERATORS
- adding a number to a string with the + operator will convert the number to a string and concantenate the two
- 3 + "4" = "34"
- when combining other arithmetic operators with strings, js prefers to convert the strings to numbers
- 3 * "4" = 12
- 1 + 2 + "pizzas" = 3 pizzas
- (1 + 2) + "pizzas" = 3 pizzas
- 1 + (2 + "pizzas"); = 12 pizzas
- concatenating a boolean with a string makes a string  --  true + "love" = "true love
- unary operator -- -true = -1

    CONVERTING A STRING TO A NUMBER
     -- var num = 3 + Number("4");
        var num = 7


FLOWCHART - outline of program logic  !! FLOWCHART + PSEUDOCODE = MUST !!

FUNCTION - code that can be reused in any scenario, abstracted and used to automate shit!!!
- functions have parameters, which recieve corresponding arguements
- arguements are "pass-by-values" = the function gets a copy of the value to operate with

function bark(name, weight) { //-- keyword name(parameter, parameter)
    //-- body of function
}

- the browser will wait until the function is called for before running it - use its name = "invoke
- parameters act like variables to the statements in the body"

ARRAY - Data structure for ordered data
- ALWAYS SET INDEX TO 0
- a javascript type that can hold many values - as many as you want in theory > computer memory - more items = slower program
- you can have an emppty array - and add things to it later
- strings, numbers, booleans, objects and other arrays, any javascript value is allowed
- values dont have to be the same type - but its alot safer to keep them the same
- used when grouping similar things
- when an array is created, each item is indexed - starting from 0
- call the last item of an array with the lenght property - see bubbles
- every array comes with a length property - properyies are values accociated with arrays
        - this contains the number of items in an array
- order of value isnt inherently important - but some purposes will require order
add a new variable to an array by using the "push" property

  SPARSE ARRAY
- an array with holes -- values 0 and 1000, array indicies  1 - 999 are valued "undefined"
- "undefined" is the value assigned to a variable that has not yet been initialised - they still take up memory
- POTENTIAL HAZARDS
- to check if for undefined:

      =   if (myArray[i] == undefined) {
           }

OBJECTS - a collection of properties - as many as you want - objects can have no properties -- you might want to add them dynamically afterwards
- variable declaration for object
- each object property has a name and value
- a propery name can be a string - "on sale": true, - quotes are needed if there is a space in the string
- no two properyies can have the same name

        PROCEEDURAL PROGRAMING - variable declarations, conditionals, function calls
        OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMING - using objects

ACCESSING PROPERTY - objectname.property
CHANGING PROPERTY - objectname.property = value
ADDING A NEW PROPERTY - objectname.newproperty = value
COMPUTING PROPERTY - if (objectname.property < value) {}
DELETING PROPERTY - delete objectname.property

         DISPLAY OBJECT IN CONSOLE - console.log(objectname)

         - variables dont hold objects they reference objects

         PASSING AN OBJECT INTO A FUNCTION
         - "pass-by-value" rules apply to this too - you are passing in the object reference, not the object
         - when an object is assigned to a variable it is given a reference to the object - it does not hold the object

FUNCTIONS INSIDE OBJECTS = METHODS - THE NAME IS ALREADY PROVIDED BY THE PROPERTY NAME
calling the METHOD - fiat.drive();    just like calling any property

- changing properties methodically instead of directly improves maintainability == encapsulation
- creating a mechanic to checks all properties for allowing certain behaviour can simplify things for you ALOT
- what looks like a variable in a method is really a property of the parent object
    = this is important to remember as when called functions look for variable definitions, they look for local and global variables and arguements
    = THEY DONT LOOK FOR OBJECT PROPERTIES/ METHOD VARIABLES - UNLESS A KEYWORD IS USED
    =       this.             this.objectPropertyName = objectPropertyValue

objects contain "state" and "behaviour" - these two interact with and inform eachother
- object properties allow us to keep state about the object
- object methods allow us to have behaviour

COMPARING OBJECTS
- two references are only equal if they reference the same object
- == and === work the same way

- a browser representation of the HTML page
- Javascript can interact with this: manage content, rarange elements, or remove them
- after modifications, the browser updates the page dynamically
- elements can also be added by attatching them to another element in the tree
- we can get all the child elements of a specified element

- doc - html - head - meta/ title/ script -- and so on
- body - divs

    !!!   - document.getElementById("greenplanet");     !!!
          - document is requesing the whole page
          - getElementById is asking for an element, the id of the element is in the ()
          - you can do what you want with this element now - assign the element to a variable

      !!!    var planet = document.getElementByld("greenplanet");   !!!

      !!!    planet.innerHTML = "Red Alert: hit by phraser fire";    !!!
             innerHTML property can be used to change the elements content

          - the document object is used to gain access to the DOM with the code - a built in object with properties and methods including "getElementByld"
          - getElementById is a method used to grab elements specified with an id
             - this gives you an "element object" - when you change this, you change what is shown on the page
              - get text or html
              - change the content
              - read an attribute
              - add an attribute
              - change an attribute
              - remove an attribute

          getElementByClassName - method for getting classes
          getElementByTagNamev- method for getting elements matching tag name soecified
          getAttribute - method for getting andor setting an elements attribute

          element objects are produced by the browser on loading and parsing through the html doc in flow
           - these element objects are arranged in the document object model
           - these objects can have properties methods -- states and behavior

           - innerHTML property represents the content within the element object
           - this includes nested elements -- you can replace the entire body if you want
           - outerHTML property refers to the content contained by the element, aswell as the element itself


ONLOAD - property of window object
- event handler functions to package code to be called when a specified event happens



      myArray.push("arrayItem"); - add new item in the index at the end of the array

TYPES

  PRIMITIVE - numvers, strings, booleans
  OBJECTS - document, car, math, dog,ect

- strings can be treated as objects ( so can booleans and numbers but less often )
- length property holds character length of a string
- charAt method gets the character at a specified index of a string - takes an integer number between 0 and the length of the string(-1) and returns a string containing a single character from the specified podition of the first string
- indexOf method - takes a string as an argument and returns the index of the first character of the first occurence of that arguement in the string
- slit method takes a delimeter and uses it to split the string into an array of strings
- substring method returns a string contained in the first string
- toLowerCase method returns a string with all uppercase changed to lowercase
- toUpperCase ------
- slice method returns a new string that has removed part of the original
- substring method returns a portion of the sting
- replace finds substring and replaces them with othe strings
- concat joins strings together
- lastIndexOf finds the last occurence of
- match searches for matches in a string using regular expressions
- trim removes whitespace from around the sting
  -

  "undefined" value for variables that havent been initialised, object with a missing property array with a value missing
- returned from a function when there is no return statement
- value of a variable when it hasnt been assigned a value
- the value of an array item that doesnt exist in a sparse array
- the value of a property that doesnt exist or has been deleted
- the value that cant be assigned to a property when an object is created

  "null" lack of object , can be used to see if one exists or not

  "NaN" - Not a Number
- used to represent numbers that cannot be represented
- the only value in Js that isnt equal to itself, or anything else
- testing for NaN by equating it with anything wont work

if (isNan (myNum)) {
myNum = 0;
 }

- 0/0     var b = "food" * 1000

  falsy values - 0, null, undefined, "" NaN
  truthy values - everything else

  CHAINING - stringing object references together
- this allows us to omit temporary variables and shorten our code
- its a shorthand for a longer series of steps to access properties and methods of objects and arrays

ship.locations.indexOf(guess)  ==  "ship" evaluates the ship object, which has a "locations" property, which has a method of "indexOf"
